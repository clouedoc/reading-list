## Quotes about learning

### [Augmenting Cogniction's essay](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)

> [...] I find Anki works much better when used in service to some personal creative project.

> It's tempting instead to use Anki to stockpile knowledge against some future day, to think “Oh, I should learn about the geography of Africa, or learn about World War II, or […]”. These are goals which, for me, are intellectually appealing, but which I'm not emotionally invested in. I've tried this a bunch of times. It tends to generate cold and lifeless Anki questions, questions which I find hard to connect to upon later review, and where it's difficult to really, deeply internalize the answers. The problem is somehow in that initial idea I “should” learn about these things: intellectually, it seems like a good idea, but I've little emotional commitment.
> By contrast, when I'm reading in support of some creative project, I ask much better Anki questions. I find it easier to connect to the questions and answers emotionally. I simply care more about them, and that makes a difference. So while it's tempting to use Anki cards to study in preparation for some (possibly hypothetical) future use, it's better to find a way to use Anki as part of some creative project.

> Does the article seem likely to contain substantial insight or provocation relevant to my project – new questions, new ideas, new methods, new results? If so, I'll have a read.

#### Paper reading algorithm

1. Spend a few minutes assessing the article.
2. Extract between 5 or 20 Anki questions about the paper. Below 5, the paper will remain an isolated orphan in the memory.

#### To get a picture about an entire field

> So, to get a picture of an entire field, I usually begin with a truly important paper, ideally a paper establishing a result that got me interested in the field in the first place. I do a thorough read of that paper, along the lines of what I described for AlphaGo. Later, I do thorough reads of other key papers in the field – ideally, I read the best 5-10 papers in the field. But, interspersed, I also do shallower reads of a much larger number of less important (though still good) papers. In my experimentation so far that means tens of papers, though I expect in some fields I will eventually read hundreds or even thousands of papers in this way.

#### Role of Anki

> In a sense, [Anki] it's an emotional prosthetic, actually helping create the drive I need to achieve understanding.

#### Card-making rules

1. Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible
2. Anki use is best thought of as a virtuoso skill, to be developed
3. Anki isn't just a tool for memorizing simple facts. It's a tool for understanding almost anything.
4. Use one big deck (mixing cards is creatively stimulating, even for unrelated fields. I.e. cooking a chicken with JavaScript).
5. Avoid orphan questions (avoid tangential material, as they won't be interconnected with the main creative memory).
6. Don't share decks (personal information help remembering, and personal cards can be useful)
7. Construct your own decks (see article for explanation)
8. Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations
9. Don't fall in the Anki improvement rabbit hole.
10. Use quotas when you want to use Anki on a specific subject

## Takeaways

- To learn knowledge, you should be emotionally invested with it
- Ankify paper's claims as what they are: *claims, not facts*. Otherwise, you may be actively making yourself stupider.
